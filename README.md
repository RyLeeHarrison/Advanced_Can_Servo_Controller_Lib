# Advanced CAN Servo Controller Library  
**MKS-SERVO Driver**

This library provides a robust and comprehensive implementation of the standards defined in the *MKS SERVO42 & 57D CAN User Manual V1.0.4*.  

After investing significant time and effort into its development, I believe this is one of the simplest and most complete solutions available for working with MKS Servo drivers over CAN.  

I created this library to save others the frustration I experienced and to provide a reliable, free tool for the community. Enjoy!
